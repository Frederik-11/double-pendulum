# Multiple pendulum

Equations of motion are determined in MatLab based on Lagrangian formula which summarizes dynamics of the entire system. Acceleration of each link can be computed by solving system of equations obtained from partial differential Lagrange's equations. Simple integration gives trajectory.
With little changes any multiple pendulum can be solved.
